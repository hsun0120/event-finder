        Program (FISP) Symposium will take place on October 18 from 8am to 5:45pm at the Price
        Center. The symposium will showcase interdisciplilnary research carried out by postdocs,
        graduate and undergraduate student researchers with funding from the campus itself. Two
        types of presentations are scheduled: oral presentations, and poster sessions (for
        one-on-one interaction with the student researchers). The oral presentations will run 15
        minutes each for undergraduates, 25 minutes for grad students and postdoctoral researchers
        (in both cases, leaving 5 minutes for Q and A at the end of each talk).</string>
